# Autonomous Car Control

A control segment for an autonomous car project using STM32 microcontrollers.  
This repository includes low-level control modules for:
- Steering
- Accelerator
- Brake
- Forward-reverse mechanisms

Designed for robust and precise autonomous vehicle operation.  
Ideal for research, prototyping, and development in autonomous systems.

## Features

- Real-time control of automotive actuators
- Modular codebase for STM32 microcontrollers
- Easily extendable to support new features or sensors
